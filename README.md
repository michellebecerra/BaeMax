TreeHacks Mental Health Chat Bot 

Created at Tree Hacks in Stanford on February 2018. 

A facebook chat bot that uses IBM watson to analyze (sentiment, mood, keywords) the users response as we ask several questions and gather information about their symptoms. 
By the end of the conversation, we suggest which of the 7 most common disorders the person might be facing and a nearby professional that can help. Right now we connect them 
to a marvel character that could experience these symptoms. 

Hosted on Heroku, Facebook and stlib. See our devpost submission for more info: https://devpost.com/software/baemax
